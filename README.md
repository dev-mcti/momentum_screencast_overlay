# momentum_screencast_overlay
A lightweight, customizable on-screen overlay for Blender tutorials, demos, livestreams, and classroom instruction.

MoCast displays mouse clicks, keystrokes, modifier keys, and UI actions directly inside the Blender 3D Viewport — giving your audience a clear and unobtrusive understanding of what you’re doing on screen.

It’s designed to be clean, flexible, and effortless to use. Think of MoCast as the chameleon of overlays: every part of it — icon, text, colors, size, behaviour — adapts to your teaching or presentation style.
